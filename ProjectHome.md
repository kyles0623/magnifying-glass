This is a free application on the Android Marketplace. I do no advertising nor collect anything for it. I am unable to have all the phones that implement the camera api differently. I am able to get 85% of the phones to work but would like to get the help of others to fix i.e. have to do workarounds for the phones who do not follow the api if possible. I will place all contributors in the top of the description as contributors on the marketplace. After all contributors agree that the application is working we will launch the new version to the market for download. Also we can add a menu selection giving the contributors credit like a popup that gives credit to all participants.
Please contact me with your wish to contribute and I will grant access to the source code.
